# Kotlin Scripts 🚀 
Before you running several command in your terminal, please ensure you have installed kotlin compiler. For more details please read kotlin documentation here [Kotlin command-line compiler](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/command-line.html). I want to highlight for how to install the Kotlin compiler in your local machine, please follow step by step below :

📝 Install Kotlin on UNIX-based systems such as OS X, Linux, Cygwin, FreeBSD, and Solaris is [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/)! To install the Kotlin compiler via SDKMAN!, run the following command in a terminal :

```$sdk install kotlin```

📝 Alternatively, on OS X you can install the compiler via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) from the command line :

```
$brew update
$brew install kotlin
```
📝 If you use [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/) on Ubuntu 16.0.4 or later, you can install the compiler from the command line :

``` $sudo snap install --classic kotlin ```
